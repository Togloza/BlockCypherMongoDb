Dogecoin Address Processor
This script connects to a MongoDB database, fetches data from a Dogecoin API, processes the data, and updates the MongoDB database with the results. It is designed to handle multiple Dogecoin addresses.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

Installation
Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository-url>
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd <project-directory>
```
Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```
**Make sure to update config.js before running the script.**

Configure the script by updating the config.js file with your MongoDB connection details and Dogecoin addresses.

```
// src/config.js
module.exports = {
    mongoUri: 'mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority',
    addresses: ['address1', 'address2', 'address3'],
    preMintVals: [premint1, premint2, premint3],
    database: '<database>',
    collection: '<collection>',
};
```
Replace `<username>` ,`<password>`, `<cluster-url>`, `<database>`, `<collection>` with your MongoDB credentials and relevant details.

**If you are using an alternative auth for the database, include the relevant mongoURI.**

The mongoURI can be found on the "Database" tab under "Deployment". Press Connect next to the relevant cluster and select Drivers.

Usage
Run the script with the following command:

```
node src/index.js
```
The script will connect to the MongoDB database, fetch data from the Dogecoin API for each address, process the data, and update the MongoDB database.

Note
Ensure that your MongoDB database is accessible, and the Dogecoin API is reachable from your environment.

**src/test.js is included to run the program without actually updating the database.**

Feel free to customize the configuration and adapt the script to your specific use case. If you encounter any issues, check the console output for error messages, and ensure that your environment meets the prerequisites.
